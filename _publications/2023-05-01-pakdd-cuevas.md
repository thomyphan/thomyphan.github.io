excerpt: 'We propose discriminative reward co-training (DIRECT) as an extension to deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Building upon the concept of self-imitation learning (SIL), we introduce an imitation buffer to store beneficial trajectories generated by the policy determined by their return. A discriminator network is trained concurrently to the policy to distinguish between trajectories generated by the current policy and beneficial trajectories generated by previous policies. The discriminatorâ€™s verdict is used to construct a reward signal for optimizing the policy. By interpolating prior experience, DIRECT is able to act as a surrogate, steering policy optimization towards more valuable regions of the reward landscape thus learning an optimal policy. Our results show that DIRECT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse- and shifting-reward environments being able to provide a surrogate reward to the policy and direct the optimization towards valuable areas.'
