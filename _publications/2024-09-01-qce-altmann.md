excerpt: "Quantum computing (QC) in the current NISQ era is still limited in size and precision. Hybrid applications mitigating those shortcomings are prevalent to gain early insight and advantages. Hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) comprises both the application of QC to improve machine learning (ML) and ML to improve QC architectures. This work considers the latter, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the search for viable quantum architectures, which we formalize by a set of generic challenges. Furthermore, we propose a concrete framework, formalized as a Markov decision process, to enable learning policies capable of controlling a universal set of continuously parameterized quantum gates. Finally, we provide benchmark comparisons to assess the shortcomings and strengths of current state-of-the-art RL algorithms."
