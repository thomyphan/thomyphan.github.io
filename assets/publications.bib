    abstract    = {Peer incentivization (PI) is a recent approach, where all agents learn to reward or to penalize each other in a distributed fashion which often leads to emergent cooperation. Current PI mechanisms implicitly assume a flawless communication channel in order to exchange rewards. These rewards are directly integrated into the learning process without any chance to respond with feedback. Furthermore, most PI approaches rely on global information which limits scalability and applicability to real-world scenarios, where only local information is accessible. In this paper, we propose Mutual Acknowledgment Token Exchange (MATE), a PI approach defined by a two-phase communication protocol to mutually exchange acknowledgment tokens to shape individual rewards. Each agent evaluates the monotonic improvement of its individual situation in order to accept or reject acknowledgment requests from other agents. MATE is completely decentralized and only requires local communication and information. We evaluate MATE in three social dilemma domains. Our results show that MATE is able to achieve and maintain significantly higher levels of cooperation than previous PI approaches. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of MATE in more realistic scenarios, where agents can defect from the protocol and where communication failures can occur.},

    abstract    = {Identifying datapoints that substantially differ from normality is the task of anomaly detection (AD). While AD has gained widespread attention in rich data domains such as images, videos, audio and text, it has has been studied less frequently in the context of reinforcement learning (RL). This is due to the additional layer of complexity that RL introduces through sequential decision making. Developing suitable anomaly detectors for RL is of particular importance in safety-critical scenarios where acting on anomalous data could result in hazardous situations. In this work, we address the question of what AD means in the context of RL. We found that current research trains and evaluates on overly simplistic and unrealistic scenarios which reduce to classic pattern recognition tasks. We link AD in RL to various fields in RL such as lifelong RL and generalization. We discuss their similarities, differences, and how the fields can benefit from each other. Moreover, we identify non-stationarity to be one of the key drivers for future research on AD in RL and make a first step towards a more formal treatment of the problem by framing it in terms of the recently introduced block contextual Markov decision process. Finally, we define a list of practical desiderata for future problems.},

    abstract    = {The development of Machine Learning (ML) models is more than just a special case of software development (SD): ML models acquire properties and fulfill requirements even without direct human interaction in a seemingly uncontrollable manner. Nonetheless, the underlying processes can be described in a formal way. We define a comprehensive SD process model for ML that encompasses most tasks and artifacts described in the literature in a consistent way. In addition to the production of the necessary artifacts, we also focus on generating and validating fitting descriptions in the form of specifications. We stress the importance of further evolving the ML model throughout its life-cycle even after initial training and testing. Thus, we provide various interaction points with standard SD processes in which ML often is an encapsulated task. Further, our SD process model allows to formulate ML as a (meta-) optimization problem. If automated rigorously, it can be used to realize self-adaptive autonomous systems. Finally, our SD process model features a description of time that allows to reason about the progress within ML development processes. This might lead to further applications of formal methods within the field of ML.}

    abstract    = {Engineering intelligent industrial systems is challenging due to high complexity and uncertainty with respect to domain dynamics and multiple agents. If industrial systems act autonomously, their choices and results must be within specified bounds to satisfy these requirements. Reinforcement learning (RL) is promising to find solutions that outperform known or handcrafted heuristics. However in industrial scenarios, it also is crucial to prevent RL from inducing potentially undesired or even dangerous behavior. This paper considers specification alignment in industrial scenarios with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose to embed functional and non-functional requirements into the reward function, enabling the agents to learn to align with the specification. We evaluate our approach in a smart factory simulation representing an industrial lot-size-one production facility, where we train up to eight agents using DQN, VDN, and QMIX. Our results show that the proposed approach enables agents to satisfy a given set of requirements.},

    abstract    = {This paper considers sustainable and cooperative behavior in multi-agent systems. In the proposed predator-prey simulation, multiple selfish predators can learn to act sustainably by maintaining a herd of reproducing prey and further hunt cooperatively for long term benefit. Since the predators face starvation pressure, the scenario can also turn in a tragedy of the commons if selfish individuals decide to greedily hunt down the prey population before their conspecifics do, ultimately leading to extinction of prey and predators. This paper uses Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to overcome a collapse of the simulated ecosystem, analyzes the impact factors over multiple dimensions and proposes suitable metrics. We show that up to three predators are able to learn sustainable behavior in form of collective herding under starvation pressure. Complex cooperation in form of group hunting emerges between the predators as their speed is handicapped and the prey is given more degrees of freedom to escape. The implementation of environment and reinforcement learning pipeline is available online.},

Current state-of-the-art approaches to cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have either focused on idealized settings without any changes or on very specialized scenarios, where the number of changing agents is fixed, e.g., in extreme cases with only one productive agent. Therefore, we propose Resilient Adversarial value Decomposition with Antagonist-Ratios (RADAR). RADAR offers a value decomposition scheme to train competing teams of varying size for improved resilience against arbitrary agent changes. We evaluate RADAR in two cooperative multi-agent domains and show that RADAR achieves better worst case performance w.r.t. arbitrary agent changes than state-of-the-art MARL.},

While it has been known that maintaining a reasonable amount of diversity often benefits the overall result of the evolutionary optimization process by adjusting the exploration/exploitation trade-off, little has been known about what diversity is optimal. We introduce the notion of productive fitness based on the effect that a specific solution candidate has some generations down the evolutionary path. We derive the notion of final productive fitness, which is the ideal target fitness for any evolutionary process. Although it is inefficient to compute, we show empirically that it allows for an a posteriori analysis of how well a given evolutionary optimization process hit the ideal exploration/exploitation trade-off, providing insight into why diversity-aware evolutionary optimization often performs better.},

While such strategies sometimes yield superior performance, they may also result in undesired or even dangerous behavior. In industrial scenarios, a system’s behavior also needs to be predictable and lie within defined ranges. To enable the agents to learn (how) to align with a given specification, this paper proposes to explicitly transfer functional and non-functional requirements into shaped rewards. Experiments are carried out on the smart factory, a multi-agent environment modeling an industrial lot-size-one production facility, with up to eight agents and different multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Results indicate that compliance with functional and non-functional constraints can be achieved by the proposed approach.}

It is shown that, using methods of curriculum learning, long-term reward discounting and stacked observations, a reinforcement-learning-based predator can achieve an economic strategy: Only hunt when there is still prey left to reproduce in order to maintain the population. Hence, purely selfish goals are sufficient to motivate a reinforcement learning agent for long-term planning and keeping a certain balance with its environment by not depleting its resources. While a comparably simple reinforcement learning algorithm achieves such behavior in the present scenario, providing a suitable amount of past and predictive information turns out to be crucial for the training success.},

Every individual can move freely in a continuous space with the objective to follow a moving target object in a partially observable environment. The individuals are self-interested as there is no explicit incentive to collaborate with each other. However, our evaluation shows that these individuals learn to form swarms out of self-interest and learn to orient themselves to each other in order to find the target object even when it is out of sight for most individuals.},

The success has been mainly based on the assumption that all teammates perfectly cooperate to optimize a global objective in order to achieve a common goal. While this may be true in the ideal case, these approaches could fail in practice, since in multi-agent systems (MAS), all agents may be a potential source of failure. In this paper, we focus on resilience in cooperative MAS and propose an Antagonist-Ratio Training Scheme (ARTS) by reformulating the original target MAS as a mixed cooperative-competitive game between a group of protagonists which represent agents of the target MAS and a group of antagonists which represent failures in the MAS. While the protagonists can learn robust policies to ensure resilience against failures, the antagonists can learn malicious behavior to provide an adequate test suite for other MAS. We empirically evaluate ARTS in a cyber physical production domain and show the effectiveness of ARTS w.r.t. resilience and testing capabilities.},

We analyze the impact the advent of these new techniques has on the discipline of rigorous software engineering, especially on the issue of quality assurance. To this end, we provide a general description of the processes related to machine learning and embed them into a formal framework for the analysis of adaptivity, recognizing that to test an adaptive system a new approach to adaptive testing is necessary. We introduce scenario coevolution as a design pattern describing how system and test can work as antagonists in the process of software evolution. While the general pattern applies to large-scale processes (including human developers further augmenting the system), we show all techniques on a smaller-scale example of an agent navigating a simple smart factory. We point out new aspects in software engineering for adaptive systems that may be tackled naturally using scenario coevolution. This work is a substantially extended take on Gabor et al.

  abstract  = {Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an important goal in building reliable machine learning systems. Especially in autonomous systems, wrong predictions for OOD inputs can cause safety critical situations. As a first step towards a solution, we consider the problem of detecting such data in a value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) setting. Modelling this problem as a one-class classification problem, we propose a framework for uncertainty-based OOD classification: UBOOD. It is based on the effect that an agent's epistemic uncertainty is reduced for situations encountered during training (in-distribution), and thus lower than for unencountered (OOD) situations. Being agnostic towards the approach used for estimating epistemic uncertainty, combinations with different uncertainty estimation methods, e.g. approximate Bayesian inference methods or ensembling techniques are possible. We further present a first viable solution for calculating a dynamic classification threshold, based on the uncertainty distribution of the training data. Evaluation shows that the framework produces reliable classification results when combined with ensemble-based estimators, while the combination with concrete dropout-based estimators fails to reliably detect OOD situations. In summary, UBOOD presents a viable approach for OOD classification in deep RL settings by leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of the agent's value function.},

We empirically test SYMBOL in four large POMDP benchmark problems to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness w.r.t. the choice of hyperparameters and evaluate its adaptive memory consumption. We also compare its performance with other open-loop planning algorithms and POMCP.},

In a value based reinforcement learning setting, we propose to use uncertainty estimation techniques directly on the agent's value estimating neural network to detect OOD samples. The focus of our work lies in analyzing the suitability of approximate Bayesian inference methods and related ensembling techniques that generate uncertainty estimates. Although prior work has shown that dropout-based variational inference techniques and bootstrap-based approaches can be used to model epistemic uncertainty, the suitability for detecting OOD samples in deep reinforcement learning remains an open question. Our results show that uncertainty estimation can be used to differentiate in- from out-of-distribution samples. Over the complete training process of the reinforcement learning agents, bootstrap-based approaches tend to produce more reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates, when compared to dropout-based approaches.},

In this paper, we propose SELFish (Swarm Emergent Learning Fish), an approach with multiple autonomous agents which can freely move in a continuous space with the objective to avoid being caught by a present predator. The predator has the property that it might get distracted by multiple possible preys in its vicinity. We show that this property in interaction with self-interested agents which are trained with reinforcement learning solely to survive as long as possible leads to flocking behavior similar to Boids, a common simulation for flocking behavior. Furthermore we present interesting insights into the swarming behavior and into the process of agents being caught in our modeled environment.},

We propose a hybrid adversarial learner where a reinforcement learning agent tries to solve a problem while an evolutionary algorithm tries to find problem instances that are hard to solve for the current expertise of the agent, causing the intelligent agent to co-evolve with a set of test instances or scenarios. We apply this setup, called scenario co-evolution, to a simulated smart factory problem that combines task scheduling with navigation of a grid world. We show that the so trained agent outperforms conventional reinforcement learning. We also show that the scenarios evolved this way can provide useful test cases for the evaluation of any (however trained) agent.},

For that, we use function approximation to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized multi-agent planning algorithm. STEP combines decentralized multi-agent planning with centralized learning, only requiring a generative model for distributed black box optimization. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two challenging and stochastic domains with large state and joint action spaces and show that STEP is able to learn stronger policies than standard multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, when combining multi-agent open-loop planning with centralized function approximation. The learned policies can be reintegrated into the multi-agent planning process to further improve performance.},

We empirically evaluate POSTS in four large benchmark problems and compare its performance with different tree-based approaches. We show that POSTS achieves competitive performance compared to tree-based open-loop planning and offers a performance memory tradeoff, making it suitable for partially observable planning with highly restricted computational and memory resources.},

    abstract    = {Making decisions is a great challenge in distributed autonomous environments due to enormous state spaces and uncertainty. Many online planning algorithms rely on statistical sampling to avoid searching the whole state space, while still being able to make acceptable decisions. However, planning often has to be performed under strict computational constraints making online planning in multi-agent systems highly limited, which could lead to poor system performance, especially in stochastic domains. In this paper, we propose Emergent Value function Approximation for Distributed Environments (EVADE), an approach to integrate global experience into multi-agent online planning in stochastic domains to consider global effects during local planning. For this purpose, a value function is approximated online based on the emergent system behaviour by using methods of reinforcement learning. We empirically evaluated EVADE with two statistical multi-agent online planning algorithms in a highly complex and stochastic smart factory environment, where multiple agents need to process various items at a shared set of machines. Our experiments show that EVADE can effectively improve the performance of multi-agent online planning while offering efficiency w.r.t. the breadth and depth of the planning process.},

However, because of its usually inferior resolution in the depth direction (50–80 nm) and rapidly deteriorating resolution in thick samples, its practical biological application has been effectively limited to two dimensions and thin samples. Here, we present the development of whole-cell 4Pi single-molecule switching nanoscopy (W-4PiSMSN), an optical nanoscope that allows imaging of three-dimensional (3D) structures at 10- to 20-nm resolution throughout entire mammalian cells. We demonstrate the wide applicability of W-4PiSMSN across diverse research fields by imaging complex molecular architectures ranging from bacteriophages to nuclear pores, cilia, and synaptonemal complexes in large 3D cellular volumes.}
