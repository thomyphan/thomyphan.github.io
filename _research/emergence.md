As self-learning agents become more and more omnipresent in the real world, they will inevitably learn to interact with each other. In self-interested MAS, where multiple autonomous systems with individual goals coexist in a shared environment, conflict and competition may arise due to opposing goals or shared resources. Naive RL approaches commonly fail to cooperate in such scenarios, possibly leading to undesirable emergent results.

To incentivize cooperative behavior in self-interested MAS, we study decentralized mechanisms, where agents learn to reward or penalize each other. These mechanisms are based on market mechanisms [1] or social behavior like acknowledgments [3], which are well studied in other fields [2]. We also consider real-world aspects like locality of information, defectors, as well as limited and noisy communication channels [3].
