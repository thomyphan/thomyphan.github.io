Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of autonomous agents that are able to solve complex problems like mastering a variety of challenging games, predicting protein structures, managing logistics scenarios, or most recently holding conversations with humans. These agents have the ability to perceive their current situation and make adequate decisions based on prior knowledge and current observation. Autonomous agents can adjust their behavior at runtime depending on changing circumstances.

This [CSCI 599 course (special topcis)](https://classes.usc.edu/term-20241/course/csci-599/) gives an introduction to the techniques used to realize such agents ranging from Automated Planning to Reinforcement Learning. The lecture covers autonomous decision-making for single- and multi-agent systems. Students have the opportunity to implement planning and reinforcement learning algorithms and test them in some [toy problems](https://github.com/thomyphan/autonomous-decision-making) to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and concepts.
