Mobile and distributed apps are an integral part of everyday life, where people use smart phones, smart watches, and many other devices most of their time to stay connected and up-to-date.

This practical course focuses on Android app programming, client-server architectures, and on-device machine learning with Android. The goal is to enable students to develop their own apps with networking capabilities for, e.g., multi-player mode or web service calls.

The course is divided into two phases:
1. **Introductory Phase**: The foundations are taught in weekly sessions with accompanying practical assignments, where students can practice the lessons to acquire necessary coding skills for the project phase.
2. **Project Phase**: The students work independently in groups on individual projects to develop an Android app. Each group is individually guided by supervising assistants and reports their progress in weekly meetings.
