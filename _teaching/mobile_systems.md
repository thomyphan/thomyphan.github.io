Mobile and distributed apps are an integral part of everyday life, where people use smart phones, smart watches, and many other devices to stay connected and up-to-date.

This practical course focuses on Android app programming, client-server architectures, and on-device machine learning with Android. The goal is to enable students to develop their own apps with networking capabilities, e.g., for multi-player games or web service calls.

The course is divided in two phases:
1. **Introductory Phase**: The foundations are taught in weekly sessions with accompanying practical assignments, where students can practice the lessons to acquire necessary coding skills for the project phase.
2. **Project Phase**: The students work independently in groups on individual projects to develop an Android app. All groups are guided by supervising assistants and report their progress in separate weekly meetings.
