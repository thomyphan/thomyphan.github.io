I am a Junior Professor at the [University of Bayreuth](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/en) heading the Chair of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu) and the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), advised by Professor [Sven Koenig](https://idm-lab.org). I earned my PhD in Computer Science at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html), advised by Professor [Claudia Linnhoff-Popien](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/claudia-linnhoff-popien/).

My areas of interest are artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. My research focuses on **multi-agent algorithms for scalable optimization** using learning and search techniques. Applications of my research are large-scale distributed and intelligent systems, such as warehouse automation, smart manufacturing, and traffic management.
