I am currently a Ph.D Student at the [Mobile and Distributed Systems Chair](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/thomy-phan/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html). 

My research focuses on **emergence and resilience in multi-agent systems** with industrial applications using planning and reinforcement learning techniques.

I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2015 from [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html) and my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2017 from LMU Munich. In 2015, I was a Visiting Scholar in Research in [Bewersdorf Lab](http://www.bewersdorflab.org) at [Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu) from February to May.
