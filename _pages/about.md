I am currently a Ph.D Student at the [Mobile and Distributed Systems Chair](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/thomy-phan/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html). 

My research focuses on **emergence and resilience in multi-agent systems** with industrial applications using planning and reinforcement learning techniques.

Before joining the Mobile and Distributed Systems Chair, I studied Computer Science at the [Department of Computer Science and Mathematics](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html) at [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html) to obtain my B.Sc degree in 2015. I continued my studies at the [Institute for Informatics](https://www.ifi.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at LMU Munich, where I received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2017.
