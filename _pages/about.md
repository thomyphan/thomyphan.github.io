I am an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), advised by Professor [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/index.html).

My areas of interests are artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. My current research focuses on **emergence and resilience in multi-agent systems** based on planning and reinforcement learning techniques.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html), advised by Professor [Claudia Linnhoff-Popien](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/team/claudia-linnhoff-popien/). I received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from LMU Munich and my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html). During my PhD, I led the [Technology and Research on Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (TRAIL)](https://www.mobile.ifi.lmu.de/ai-lab/) at LMU Munich. In 2015, I was a Visiting Scholar in Research in [Bewersdorf Lab](http://www.bewersdorflab.org) at [Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu) for three months.
